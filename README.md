# Campus Link School App (Archived)

This repository represents the **first phase of the Campus Link School App project**, which I started as a solo developer.  
It contains my initial experiments, learning process, and early development work.

➡️ The project has now moved to an **organization repo** where I collaborate with other developers and students:  
[Go to the LogicLabs Academy](https://github.com/LogicLabs-Academy)

## This repo remains public as a record of my learning journey.

## Why This Repo Exists

- This repo shows the **original work** I did alone.
- It includes lessons learned from real-world challenges, including:
  - Accidentally pushing `.env` files
  - Docker/Postgres database management
  - Deployment experiments
  - Learning Docker Postgres and dumping of SQL files into a hosted databse etc
- These experiences helped me improve my workflow and prepare the project for **collaboration**.
